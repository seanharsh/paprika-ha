# paprika-ha

An unofficial [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) Integration for Paprika Recipe Manager.

## Features

### Meal Plans

The integration exposes a Calendar Entity for each of the meal types in the app.

### Grocery Lists

The integration exposes each grocery list from your Paprika account as a 'todo list' entity in Home Assistant. 

**Note:** Due to how Paprika's API works, deleting an item marks it purchased in the paprika app.

## Installing

The integration is available in [HACS](https://hacs.xyz). After you've installed HACS, simply:

1. Go to HACS, search for 'paprika', and install the extension. Restart Home Assistant. Alternatively, you can click this link to go straight there: [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=rbrunt&repository=paprika-ha)

2. Under "Devices and Service", set up "Paprika", enter your username and password, and you're done!
